                          It takes 3 days of traveling to reach the Moon and, depending on speed, 
                          it would take a long time to reach the closest star Proxima Centauri.<br>
                          Manned spacecraft are designed to keep good air inside them and to protect astronauts from extreme temperatures.<br>
                          
                          We gain most of our information about the items in space from different kinds of telescopes. Some of them are space telescopes, put in outer space for a better view. Space probes also explore planets, 
                          comets and other space objects that are not too far.</p>
